 If you want to learn to drive in any reasonable amount of time, Kick Start Riding and Driving School is the place to be. Stacy is a great instructor, and has a great team. All your paper work is done for you and hassle free. Professional driving school with great customer service and communication. Students with little to no experience driving, I would certainly recommend Kick Start, best driving school hands down!!

 To be honest, Stacy and KickStart Driving/Riding school was like my older sister. They covered everything for me from inspection, to insurance to defense driving to getting my new drivers license in my hand without ever standing in line. And if you have a busy schedule like mine, KickStart is the place to go!!! For all your riding and driving needs, call KickStart. Professional, friendly and the best customer service out there!!!!!
